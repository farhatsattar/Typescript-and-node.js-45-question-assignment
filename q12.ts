//12. Greetings: Start with the array you used in Exercise 11, but instead of just printing each person’s name, print a message to them. The text of each message
//should be the same, but each message should be personalized with the person’s name.

let names1:string[] = ["Ayesha","Fatima","Anaya","Nadia"];
let message :string = "DO you like to eat pizza?";
console.log(names1[0]+ " "+ message);
console.log(names1[1]+ " "+ message);
console.log(names1[2]+ " "+ message);
console.log(names1[3]+ " "+ message);
