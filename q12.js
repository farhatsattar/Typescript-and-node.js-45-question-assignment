//12. Greetings: Start with the array you used in Exercise 11, but instead of just printing each person’s name, print a message to them. The text of each message
//should be the same, but each message should be personalized with the person’s name.
var names1 = ["Ayesha", "Fatima", "Anaya", "Nadia"];
var message = "DO you like to eat pizza?";
console.log(names1[0] + " " + message);
console.log(names1[1] + " " + message);
console.log(names1[2] + " " + message);
console.log(names1[3] + " " + message);
